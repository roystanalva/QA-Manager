# Contributing to qa-manager

The unusual thing about this repository: **its main source of changes is the retro step of a
real test session, not a backlog.** When `/qa` finishes a session, the manager collects the
executors' retro sections and edits the engine, the project profile, the project's skills or
the knowledge base right there. So the strongest contribution looks like «this happened in a
session, it cost a round, here is the rule that prevents it» — with the precedent kept in the
text. That is why the instructions are full of lines like «precedent: …»: a rule
without its story gets deleted by the next person who finds it inconvenient.

## Where a change belongs

Four addresses, and picking the right one matters more than the wording:

| The change… | goes to |
|---|---|
| would work in any project (roles, acceptance, formats, degradations) | the engine — this repository |
| names a specific tool, environment, class or account | that project's `.opencode/qa-profile.md` |
| is a fact about a product (API contract, feature behavior, limits) | that project's knowledge base |
| is a pitfall of a project-local skill | that skill |

In doubt between the first two: if you cannot state the rule without naming your tracker or
your staging host, it is not an engine rule.

## Working on the engine

The engine is plain markdown — skills, agent instructions and templates. There is no build.

```bash
python3 .github/scripts/validate-engine.py   # structure, frontmatter, templates, contract
```

Installing the engine **copies** the files into the project, so editing your clone
changes nothing by itself. To try an edit:

```bash
# bump "version" in engine.json first, then pull the clone and re-run /qa-setup in the project
```

The new copy is picked up by the next launch of `opencode`.

## Two rules that are easy to miss

1. **Every engine edit bumps the patch version** in `engine.json`. Without it
   the update does not reach anyone's project copy.
2. **Ask whether the edit requires anything of a project profile** — a new header key, a new
   mandatory question in a section, a rename. If it does, bump the version in
   `PROFILE-CONTRACT.md` and add a row to its history table; if it does not, leave the contract
   version alone. A skipped bump makes profiles drift silently; a needless one gives every
   project a false «your profile is behind» warning.

## The eval suite

`validate-engine.py` checks structure; it cannot tell you whether a rule still fires. That is what
`evals/` is for — five cases over the decisions the engine most easily loses (starting without a
profile, honouring a profile of `none`s, the output language, continuing an existing session,
refusing an `engine-clone` that points at an installation).

```bash
# run the evals by hand in opencode: each case's case.yaml is a scenario + expected outcome
```

It is **not** part of CI and is not meant to be: every case is a real opencode session on your own
credential, and a judge's verdict is not deterministic. Run it before cutting a release, and treat
a case that dropped as a regression to explain rather than a number to accept. The suite's own
README covers the flags, the measured cost and how to add a case.

## Releases

Versions are bumped constantly by retros, so releases are cut deliberately rather than
automatically:

```bash
# CHANGELOG.md gets a section for the version first
git tag v0.11.0 && git push origin v0.11.0
```

The tag must match `version` in `engine.json` — the release workflow refuses to run otherwise.
It then builds the archive and publishes the release with the notes from `CHANGELOG.md`.

## No identifiers from real projects

The engine travels between projects and gets published, so **nothing in its files may name
the project a lesson came from**: no tracker ids (`ABC-123`, `service#456`), no environment
hostnames, no service, company or account names. Write the precedent by its mechanics —
«precedent: a retest where the defect's symptom went stale together with the build» — and
drop the address. The mechanics are the lesson; the number is a client's data.

Session files, a project profile and a project's knowledge base are the exception: they live
inside their project and may name anything.

This is enforced by CI, not by good intentions — `validate-engine.py` fails on a task-shaped
identifier and tells you the file and line.

## Style

Match what is already there: an instruction states what to do, then why, and closes with the
precedent that earned it. Keep the identifiers untranslated (profile keys, session file names,
`subagent_type` values, the `Blocker/Critical/Major/Minor` scale). If a patch to an instruction
repeats for the third time, fold it into the main text instead of adding a fourth phrasing.
