# /qa — test session

## Step 0. The project profile

Read `.opencode/qa-profile.md` — it is a short map: the capability header (`tracker`, `tms`, `test-cases`, `environments`, `logs`,
`autotests`, `browser`, `secrets`, `knowledge`, `sessions`, `engine-clone`, `language`) plus pointer sections. The profile answers every
project question: how to read tasks, how to create cases, how to reach the environments, how to run the autotests.

**Do not read the `.opencode/qa-profile/*.md` subfiles up front** — pull them in targeted, at the moment of the step that needs them: Tracker
— while reading the task (step 1), Environments and Browser — before the preflight check (step 4), Autotests — while writing the automator's
brief (step 5), the project's report format — at step 6. The pipeline below points at the profile at each such spot. A subfile the session
does not need (browser.md on a pure backend task) is not read at all; a subfile's first screen is the quick flow, the pitfalls come below.

**The session's language is `language` from the profile** (no field → the language of this file, i.e. English): everything the user sees is
written in it — the whole conversation plus every artifact: the plan, the briefs, the result files, the report, the retro, the TMS cases,
the tracker comment, and the project profile itself. Files rendered from templates go in it too (translate the table headings). **The
engine's own instructions are in English, and that says nothing about the output language** — the output language is set by `language`
alone.

**The executors are held to the same rule, and it reaches them only through the prompt: make `Output language: <language>` the first line
of every executor's prompt** (the analyst, the manual tester, the automator — the brief file repeats it, the prompt carries it). A subagent
starts working, and narrating what it does, before it has opened the profile, and that narration — its reasoning, its progress notes, its
final summary — is shown to the user in the same console as your own. Precedent: the executors' files came out in the project's language
while the whole round read as English in the console, because the language lived in a profile the executor reached late instead of in the
prompt it started from.

No profile → do not start the session: suggest the user run `/qa-setup`. A capability declared `none` **or a key missing from the profile**
→ apply the degradation from the table at the end of this file; the profile does not invent degradations of its own. The single exception is
`test-cases`: a missing key reads as `inline` (the manual tester creates the case after the run), not as `none` — otherwise a contract
update would silently switch cases off in profiles written before version 5.

**The contract version.** Compare the profile's `contract-version` (no field → 1) with the current version in the «Contract versions»
section of `PROFILE-CONTRACT.md` (the engine root, next to this skill: `../../PROFILE-CONTRACT.md`). The profile is behind → **do not
block** the session: tell the user in one line that the profile is behind (what is new — from the version history) and that `/qa-setup`
closes the gap, then carry on with degradations for the missing keys.

The `<sessions>` path below is the value of `sessions` from the profile (e.g. `docs/test-sessions/`).

## Roles

**QA Manager — that is you, the main session.** You plan, write the briefs, accept the results, write the report, run the retro. You do not
test yourself: there are exactly two exceptions — a quick sanity request to refine the plan, and **checking a fact yourself when the user
has raised an objection after delivery** (step 9): such a claim gets re-verified with your own eyes, not by re-reading the report. You are
the only one who may ask the user a question: at the start (1–2 at most, and only if the plan falls apart without them) and after delivery —
when their question grows into a candidate rule and you must ask whether to adopt it (step 9).

**QA Manual — a subagent** (`subagent_type: "qa-manual"`, its instruction lives in the qa-manager engine). The manual check on the environment;
with `test-cases: inline` also the TMS case for what was verified, while with `upfront` it runs the analyst's cases and creates none of its
own. Its result is the evidence for automation and, with `inline`, also the source of the case id. It does not touch code.

**QA Analyst — a subagent** (`subagent_type: "qa-analyst"`, its instruction lives in the qa-manager engine). Runs when `test-cases: upfront`:
unfolds the plan's scenarios into test cases **from the requirements**, before the run and without seeing the environment. Creates no files
in the session — it receives its assignment in the prompt and reports through the cases plus a final summary. Files no bugs and passes no
verdict on whether things work.

**QA Automator — a subagent** (`subagent_type: "qa-automator"`, its instruction lives in the qa-manager engine). From the manual tester's
evidence: an autotest driven to green and linked to a case (with `upfront` — from the analyst, with `inline` — from the manual tester, with
`none` — to the tracker task), then the automation flag on the case. The project's automation specifics (code map, code style) live in the
profile, not here.

The executors ask no questions — not one of them.

## The pipeline

**1. Understand the task and assemble the bundle.** The input is a link/id of a tracker task or free-form text. Read the task with the tools
from the profile (Tracker section): the description and **the comments, mandatorily** — that is where the requirements, the status and the
related changes live. Check for **related tasks** in three ways, not one: (1) explicit links/relations; (2) the task's **subtasks and
parent**; (3) a substring search on the title (neighboring FE/BE tasks of the same area). Empty relations do not mean «there are none». If a
frontend task has a related backend task in a suitable status on the same environment, we test them in **one session** (and vice versa).
Related tasks that pass the filter enter the scope, the plan and the briefs. **Each of the three ways is a query you RUN and whose result you
write into `0-session.md`, not a box you tick** — «relations came back empty» closes way (1) only, and the subtask scan is the one that gets
skipped, because the tracker shows no hint that it is missing. Where the tracker's API makes subtasks awkward to list (a timeout on the
child-of filter, a parent field that is not searchable), the project's tracker skill names the working route; run it. And **every related
task that enters the scope is read the same way the main one is — description AND comments in full**, never by its title in a listing.

For a **parent** task, the acceptance scope is set by **the labels of the subtasks currently in a testing status**: accepting the FE subtask
means a verdict on the frontend, while requirements that cannot be met without the backend are addressed to the backend task; **if no such
task exists in the tracker at all, that is a finding for the analyst**, not the executor's fault. Precedent: the parent had only an FE
subtask, and no BE task existed for half of the requirements.

**A task whose own description is written in the USER's voice and that carries no labels is a container — the engineering spec is in a
subtask, and testing the container instead costs the round its scope.** The tell is in the text itself: user stories, «I as an officer want
…», numbered FR/AC phrased as outcomes rather than as interfaces, and no label saying which layer is being accepted. A spec written for
implementers looks different — tables of columns and types, endpoint signatures with response codes, configuration keys, a status mapping —
and it lives one level down, under a label. Both texts are real requirements and they do not contradict each other; they answer different
questions, and the acceptance verdict belongs to the lower one. Reading only the container yields verdicts that are not wrong but are
addressed to nobody: the defects land against a task that implements nothing, and the criteria the implementers actually committed to are
never checked. The check is one query at step 1 and it is cheap; the correction after delivery is not — it re-frames every finding.
Precedent: two full rounds were accepted against a parent's user-story spec; the backend subtask, found only when the customer asked, held
its own acceptance criteria, an explicit signature scheme «over the raw body, without re-serialisation», a required status field on the
neighbouring entity and a background reconciler with a default interval — four of the round's findings turned out to be verbatim violations
of a spec the round had never read, and several «requirements gaps for the analyst» turned out to be answered there.

**Start preconditions** — not met → tell the user and do not begin:
- **the mode is determined**: the status of the task (and of the related ones in scope) determines the session's mode — **full cycle**
  (manual check + autotest + case) or **automation-only** (a minimal manual run for the autotest's evidence, without full bug hunting). The
  status→mode mapping is in the profile, Tracker section;
- **the environment is determined** (env — from the task or the profile). It is not — that is exactly your one question to the user.
- **the verdict on the requirements is passed** (required with `test-cases: upfront`; useful but optional in the other modes). While reading
  the task, answer: do its requirements work as the reference the product is checked against. **Spec-grade** — the requirements are written
  as requirements: there are acceptance criteria, functional requirements or numbered items, each with its own verifiable outcome; the
  expected result reads out of the text verbatim, nothing needs to be guessed. **Draft** — everything else, including a page-long detailed
  task description: solid prose does not become spec-grade by being long, the expected result has to be extracted from it, and extraction is
  guesswork; requirements scattered across a comment thread and a task like «fix the filter behavior» are always draft. Write the verdict
  with a one-phrase rationale as a line in `0-session.md` and carry it into the analyst's prompt and the manual tester's brief: it decides
  whether an executor may edit a case's expected result. **A verdict can be compound — split it across the parts of the task instead of
  issuing one for everything.** In a typical refactoring or follow-up change the contract is described verbatim (field tables, response
  codes, permission matrices) — that is spec-grade, whereas the requirement «everything else works as before» cannot be: there the
  expectation equals the observable behavior of the previous build. The phrasing «spec-grade on the contract, draft on „nothing broke“»
  saves a round: the executor will not write off a mismatch with a verbatim item as «well, it's a minor thing», and will not file a defect
  where the expectation would have had to be guessed. Precedent: without that split, a `400` instead of the declared `403` would have been
  dismissed as «they're both 4xx anyway». **A «draft» verdict lowers the strictness of the expectations; it does not excuse you from a
  line-by-line verdict.** On an analysis or decision task sitting in a testing status, the thing being accepted IS its proposal — however
  tentatively it is worded. Any enumerable block of the task (a proposal, a rollout plan, a list of changes, «what was already done») is
  unfolded into a table «item → pass / partial / not covered → what closes it», and «not covered, because <channel>» is a full result while
  silence is not. Where an item cannot be verified at all, there is still one thing QA can say about it on the merits: **does it conflict
  with the observable state?** Precedent: three of a proposal's four items needed a console QA has no access to, so the block was marked
  draft and its items were folded into the general «not covered» list — the customer had to ask for the per-item verdict; and the one item
  that looked purely unverifiable turned out to clash with the live contract, which was the most useful sentence in the section.

Then the product knowledge (the path and the reading rules — the profile, Knowledge section): read the sections the task touches and the
findings of past sessions on them.

**A link or a reference to a document outside the tracker is part of the requirements, and it is chased BEFORE the verdict on them.** First
try to open it yourself — the session's own connectors often reach a spreadsheet, a doc or a design file, and the attempt costs one call.
Only what you genuinely cannot reach (an MR/PR description, a dashboard, an internal system) becomes the start question to the user, asked
once, before slicing the plan; black-box against the spec is a valid fallback only after a refusal, and the report says so. Either way the
contents are a list of **what was done or what is required**, never permission to read code. The shapes both cases take, and what skipping
them cost, are in `references/planning.md`.

If there is a critical ambiguity (which environment? which direction?) — one question to the user now, and no questions after that.

**2. Create or continue the session.** First, the monthly sweep: session folders from previous months (`<sessions>/YYYY-MM-DD_*` whose month
is older than the current one) get moved with a dumb `mv` into that month's archive `<sessions>/<YYYY-MM>/` (create it if needed). The
invariant: the root of `<sessions>/` holds what is alive (the current month and active retests), the month folders hold closed history; do
not touch `side-findings.md` or the neighboring non-session folders. **Anything actually moved → read
`references/session-folder.md`, section «Sweeping», before going on**: `mv` breaks every link to a session folder silently, and fixing them
is a pass of its own that two sessions have already paid for. Nothing to move — read nothing.

Then check whether a session for this task (and for the related ones) already exists: search for the task id in folder names and in
`0-session.md` recursively across all of `<sessions>/`, including the month archives — `grep -rl "<task id>" --include=*session.md
<sessions>/`.

- **A session existed** → this is a new round in **the same folder**: the folder is renamed to the current date (out of a month archive it
  returns to the root of `<sessions>/`), the round's new files **continue the folder's running numbering** with a round-number suffix
  (`8-manual-task-2.md`, `9-manual-result-2.md`, …), the report is not created anew — the same `99-report.md` is updated with a mandatory
  comparison against the previous round — and task comments that appeared since the last round are appended to the «Raw source» section of
  `0-session.md`. **Read `references/session-folder.md`, section «Continuing a session», before the round's first move**: dating the round's
  trigger, what the rename must bring to the convention besides the date, what the executor's brief carries over from the previous round,
  when the analyst is re-launched at all, and how stale evidence is marked — all of it is decided before planning and cannot be added
  afterwards.
- **There was no session** → a new folder `<sessions>/<YYYY-MM-DD>_<source>-<slug>/` (example: `2026-08-10_acme-412-partial-cascade`).

**A folder holding files under the old naming scheme** (`session.md`, `report.md`, `*-r2.md`, …) → the same file, section «Folders from the
old scheme»: what is left as it is, and the two files that are renamed even so.

The file skeletons live in `templates/` next to this skill:
```
0-session.md           # meta (tasks, mode, env, status, round log) + the task's raw source
1-plan.md              # the plan: what we test, why, scenarios by priority
2-manual-task.md       # the manual tester's brief
3-manual-result.md     # written by the manual tester, incrementally; the automator's evidence
4-automator-task.md    # the automator's brief (the manager writes it after accepting the manual round)
5-automator-result.md  # written by the automator
7-retro.md             # the retro
99-report.md           # the manager's report — one per session, updated every round
```

**The task's raw source goes into `0-session.md`.** Everything read at step 1 goes in there verbatim: the full text of the task (and of the
related ones pulled into scope) and **all the comments** — as a separate «Raw source» section, with no paraphrasing and no cuts. It is the
session's only raw layer: from then on you, the executors and the next round read the requirements out of it instead of going back to the
tracker. Secrets that ended up in the task text or the comments (passwords, tokens, magic links) are masked per the «Secrets» rules below.

The number in a name is the order of the file's appearance, i.e. the order of work; paired executor files are named «role-type»
(`manual-task` / `manual-result`). **Zero is `0-session.md`**: not a step of work but the session's entry point (meta and raw source) — work
starts with the plan. From there the numbering is **running across the folder and is never reset**: a file gets the next free number at the
moment of creation, and the round is marked with a digit suffix. A second round continues from 8 — `8-manual-task-2.md`,
`9-manual-result-2.md`, `10-retro-2.md`; if a plan reappears too, it goes under its own number in the same sequence (`8-plan-2.md`, which
makes the manual brief the 9th).

**Two files sit outside the numbering — they are not duplicated but updated in place: `0-session.md` (the session's entry point) and
`99-report.md` (the report).** The number 99 keeps the report last in the folder listing no matter how many rounds there are, and removes
the question «which report is the current one»: there is always exactly one. Round 2+ does not create `*-report-2.md` — it edits
`99-report.md`: the «What is confirmed», «Findings», «Not covered», «Automation», «Environment leftovers» and «Tracker comment» sections are
brought to their **current state** (a finding's status changes — `fixed in R2`, `reproduces in R2`, `regression R2`; new ones are appended
to the same running table), while the round's delta goes as a block at the top of «Round history». Nothing from past rounds is erased
silently: a fact that stopped being true changes its status, it does not vanish.
**3. The plan.** Scenarios by priority: first the business-critical ones and whatever the task fixed/changed, then the negative ones, then
the regression around them. Each scenario carries an expected business effect (what must change), not «get a 200». **Execution order ≠
priority order:** negatives that do not mutate the environment under expected behavior are run before mutating positives — a clean state is
worth more; but keep in mind that on a buggy server a «safe» negative may mutate the environment after all (account for that in the artifact
estimate). **A scenario that closes a requirement with a couple of cheap reads goes before scenarios with fragile preconditions, not after**
— otherwise the answer to «is the requirement met» is hostage to someone else's cause: in one session the check «the field is served to both
consumers» (two GETs) sat after the trader scenario and would have gone unverified had the executor not raised IP2P matching.

The source of the scenarios is **the task's requirements and the product's behavior, not the implementation**. We test as a black box: do
not pull MR/PR diffs by default — it clutters the context and skews the optics («I read how it was done and decided it was right» — whereas
the comparison must be against the requirement, not the code). Reading the changed code is allowed purely as an extra, for yourself, when
the requirements are ambiguous and there is nowhere else to clarify them; what you read out of the code does not go into the plan or the
briefs — those carry only the expected behavior from the requirements.

**Before writing the plan, read `references/planning.md`** — the catalogue of scenario shapes with the way to plan each and the precedent
that paid for it: refactoring tasks, batch windows, already-elapsed states, unknown oracles, branching expectations, non-determinism, guard
requirements, cost and reversibility gates, degradation requirements. A shape planned by intuition instead of by its entry costs a pass of
the round at best and a false verdict at worst. Read it whole, once per session — the value of the list is in the shapes you did not think
of, so grepping it for the one already on your mind defeats the point.

**3.5. Test design** (only with `test-cases: upfront`; with `inline` and `none` the step is skipped entirely). The plan's scenarios are
turned into cases by the `qa-analyst` subagent — **before** the manual run and without seeing the environment, so that a case describes a
requirement rather than an observation. It has no brief file: the plan already contains the scenarios, the scope and the priorities, and a
brief file would be a retelling of it. Launch `Agent` with `subagent_type: "qa-analyst"`, passing in the prompt:
- `Output language: <language>` **as the first line** (step 0);
- the path to the session folder (it will read `0-session.md` and `1-plan.md` itself);
- **the verdict on the requirements** from step 1 (`spec-grade` / `draft` + the rationale) — it sets the analyst's strictness bar;
- **the targeted reading list** — as in the other executors' briefs: the profile's TMS section is mandatory, plus knowledge-base files for
  the task's domain.

The analyst returns a summary in three sections: cases, uncovered requirements, retro. **Move the uncovered requirements into `0-session.md`
immediately** — in the same pass, before launching the manual tester: two executors stand between the analyst and the report, and all that
time the round's most valuable result would live only in your context. The «Uncovered requirements» section is a table «requirement (quote)
· why there is no case · status»; in round 2+ the rows' statuses get updated, the rows are never deleted. Hold the retro until step 7. Move
the case ids from the summary into `0-session.md` in the same pass (the «TMS cases» field — with `upfront` there are usually several): that
is where the manual tester's brief takes them from, and in round 2+ the next round does too.

**A case whose expectation source is `assumption` under a «spec-grade» verdict is a requirements gap**, not a working detail: the analyst
had to guess an outcome where the spec is silent. Such items go into the report with an explicit «needs an analyst's decision» (step 6) — in
the same manner as any other requirements gap. The step works in automation-only mode too: there is no manual run there, but the automator
needs a case for the link — the analyst writes it from the requirements just the same.

**4. The manual check** (skipped in automation-only mode). Four moves — preflight, the brief, the launch, acceptance. **Before writing the
brief, read `references/manual-brief.md`**: the situations a round lands in (preflight and access, what the brief must carry, a retest
round, the executor mid-run, accepting the result), each with the line that costs nothing to write and a whole pass to omit. Read it whole —
an executor is briefed once, and a situation you did not foresee cannot be added to the brief afterwards.
- **the preflight check** — if the scenarios involve the browser (frontend tasks, UI verification): **before** launching the executor,
  verify the access yourself against the profile's checklist (Browser section). Something does not work — **tell the user right away** and
  do not launch the executor until the access is fixed. What preflight must hand over about the state it created — its owner, the time it
  was true, the identity for the executor to check before anything else — is in `references/manual-brief.md`;
- `2-manual-task.md`: the context in one paragraph, the environment, the scenarios with their expected effects, where to write the result,
  and **the targeted reading list**: which profile subfiles and knowledge-base files (and, where needed, which of their sections) are
  relevant to exactly this task — you built the plan and know that better than the executor (a BE task needs no browser techniques; a task
  about fees needs the wallets domain). The executor reads what is listed plus the profile map itself; everything else — only when stuck. Do
  not retell the project's knowledge — the executor will take it from the profile and the project's skills;
- launch `Agent` with `subagent_type: "qa-manual"`; in the prompt — `Output language: <language>` as the first line, then the path to the
  session folder and to the brief file. Wait for it to finish (the notification arrives on its own) and do nothing on its behalf;
- accepting `3-manual-result.md`: failures carry trace ids (with `logs: none` do not require them and do not make the executor note their
  absence — the request and response bodies are enough), bugs carry a severity, the checks are business-effect-based, the request/response
  evidence suffices for an autotest, **the case is created and named in the «Summary»** (with `test-cases: inline` and `tms` ≠ none; with
  `upfront` the cases were already written by the analyst — check instead the **list of case corrections** (`case → was → now → why`) and
  the **case candidates**: a scenario uncovered during the run with no case behind it the manual tester does not create but names — you
  decide, and the decision is one of two: take the candidate into the next round's plan, or hand it back to the analyst together with a
  widened scope. Mention the result's list of case corrections in the report in one line: it shows where a case drifted from the
  requirement). Gaps → an addendum to the brief and a second pass, not a manual redo. **Before reading the result yourself, run the checker over it**: `python3 ".opencode/skills/qa/scripts/check_session.py" <the result file>` — leaked secret values, shifted table columns and oversized cells, none of which survive being noticed later. It judges nothing about the content: that part is yours;
- **before locking findings into the report — reconcile their class against the tracker** (with `tracker` ≠ none): by searching for the
  defect's keyword, not only within your own task and not only in its comments; the search may go beyond the project's boundaries — the same
  defect is sometimes filed in a neighboring one. A finding already filed is presented as «confirmation of a known issue: reproduces on the
  environment as of <date>, no new action required»; a related one as «a new trigger for task N, to be added to its DoD». Otherwise the
  report breeds duplicates and loses trust. **Search among closed tasks too:** before writing «this does not exist and there is no task for
  it», check whether a Done task with exactly this scope exists — then the framing changes from «this needs to be filed» to «the work was
  closed as done, but it is not in the product», and that is a different conversation with the team. Precedent: the backend task for the
  list's filters and sorting had been closed six months earlier, while not a single filter had appeared in the contract.

**5. Automation** (when `autotests` ≠ none). Based on the manual round's results, decide what to automate (usually the 1–2 main scenarios;
if the feature is broken, automation may be postponed until the fix, with that recorded in the report). Not everything deserves an autotest
— the local rules on «what we do not automate» are in the profile, Autotests section. Before writing the brief, check the existing coverage
(grep the tests: endpoint, tags, «also covers») — the preference is always: an existing test already covers it → write nothing; a test for
the same area exists → **add a step to it**; and only then a separate test. A small feature or a follow-up on existing behavior is always a
step in an existing test (reusing the setup is the main win); a separate test is justified only for a large standalone feature. **The cost
of a run is as much an input to the decision as the value of the coverage.** A scenario that needs dozens of operations to reach its
conclusion (a series for a distribution, long waits for workers) costs minutes in every nightly run — estimate that price and, if it is
noticeable, put the decision to the user **before** launching the automator, not after. Precedent: two tests (30 payments and 20 payouts
with a wait for the cascade) were written and then stopped by the user on the very first run with the words «that run is too expensive» —
the price was visible from the manual result in advance. **The size of the feature is an independent ground, alongside the cost of the
run.** A cheap merge into an existing test can still be work nobody wants: a feature the size of one query parameter (a filter, a flag) may
deserve no test at all, whatever the run costs. So the question to the user before launching the automator is not only «this run is
expensive?» but also «is this feature worth a test at all?» — and it is asked **before**, not after the automator has edited the code.
Precedent: the manager sliced the automation as steps merged into three existing tests (the cheapest possible form) and launched the
automator; the user's answer was «we only automate bigger features, this is just a filter», and the edits had to be reverted mid-run. **And
translate a statistical criterion into a stable assertion yourself**: the manual run's acceptance threshold («each variant ≥20 %») flakes in
a test; what should be asserted is the degenerate outcome («each variant occurred at least once»). In doubt — record «no automation was
done» in the report with a reason; that is a valid outcome:
- `4-automator-task.md`: the scenarios, a reference to `3-manual-result.md` as the evidence, the candidate per the profile's code map, the
  case id (with `test-cases: upfront` — from the analyst, the manual tester merely confirms it; with `inline` — from the manual tester),
  **the targeted reading list** (which profile/knowledge subfiles are needed — as in the manual tester's brief); the names of any
  helpers/methods you mention — and the concrete values of their parameters, if you quote them in the brief — must be verified by grepping
  the code rather than from memory (an inexact name or number = an extra iteration for the automator). **A rule of the project's own profile
  is checked against the specific helper before it goes into the brief as an instruction** — «these helpers assert 200 internally, so add a
  raw variant» is true of the profile's general case and may be false of the two helpers this round touches; a brief that carries it
  unchecked orders work that is not needed. In automation-only mode there is no
  evidence — write exactly that, and the automator will do a minimal run itself; in that mode a case exists with `upfront` (the analyst
  wrote it) and is absent with `inline` — then the automator creates it itself;
- launch `Agent` with `subagent_type: "qa-automator"`; in the prompt — `Output language: <language>` as the first line, then the path to the
  session folder and to the brief file;
- **asking for the price of the coverage, say what measures it:** run logs often lack timestamps on step lines, so a step's duration is
  unreadable from the log — then measure by a run on reverted code, repeated when the run-to-run spread rivals the delta;
- accepting `5-automator-result.md` (the checker first, as in step 4 — test code carries credentials more often than prose does): the test was actually run (the run log is cited), the case exists in the TMS, and the test-to-case link
  in the code matches the case (with `test-cases: none` there is no case — then what gets checked is the link to the tracker task per the
  profile's convention).

**6. The report** `99-report.md`: the verdict (done / bugs / blocked), what is confirmed against the requirements, the findings, what is not
covered and why, what was automated, the links (task, case, test), the open questions — the goal is zero. **There is one report per session
and it always lives under the number 99:** round 2+ does not create a new file but updates this one — bringing the sections to their current
state and appending the delta («what got fixed, what did not, what newly broke») as a block at the top of «Round history». The skeleton is
`templates/99-report.md`; **the project's format from the profile outranks the template — read it BEFORE writing and render by it, not by
the template** (the template is a skeleton for projects without a format of their own; its columns and sections are not dogma). Precedent:
three customer objections in one session — a superfluous column, fixed rows, internal links inside cells — all from rendering the template
while the profile described its own format.

**Before writing the report, read `references/report.md`** — the catalogue of situations a finding lands in: whether it is a finding at
all, how the business sentence is worded so that shortening it does not make it false, and the table's own mechanics. Read it whole, once
per session, after the project's format and before the first cell: a finding withdrawn after delivery burns its id and forces edits to the
report, the registries and the knowledge base, and every entry in that file was paid for exactly once that way.

**With `test-cases: upfront` the report's sections are assembled from the cases, not from prose.** «What is confirmed against the
requirements» is the analyst's cases with the manual tester's verdict on each (requirement → case → pass/fail/not covered); «Not covered» is
the «Uncovered requirements» section from `0-session.md`, brought to its current state per the run's results (the manual tester may have
closed a row with a fact from the environment or, conversely, added a reason). Cases whose expectation the analyst marked `assumption` under
a «spec-grade» verdict are presented as requirements gaps with an explicit «needs an analyst's decision».

**What counts as a finding.** Only what reproduces and has been confirmed: anything «presumed» from automated runs is first confirmed by
hand. Environment leftovers (test data, traces of a run) are not filed as bugs. Before assigning a priority — reconcile against the
**verbatim** text of the requirement: behavior explicitly stated in the spec is not a bug, at most a UX observation.

**How a finding is shaped for the tracker — the title line, the split by layer, what stays out of the cells, and what goes to the
side-findings registry instead of the report — is in `references/report.md`**, which you have already read at the start of this step.

**Priorities (the default, if the profile did not set its own scale):** `Blocker` (blocks usage or release) → `Critical` (security, or a
mismatch with the requirements that genuinely blocks a section) → `Major` (misleading behavior, data and audit quality, requirements gaps) →
`Minor` (cosmetics). Calibration: data quality and completeness are `Major`, not `Critical`.

**ID numbering:** running across the project, numbers are not reused, gaps are normal; before assigning one, find the current maximum across
all the reports (by grep) rather than continuing from memory. The prefixes and the current maximum come from the profile.

**A finding's cell — the order is mandatory**, 3–5 lines and **no more than ~850 characters** (the limit is the same for a Critical and a
Minor; longer, and the tracker's reader stops reading while the customer sends the report back to be shortened). **Before delivering, run
the checker over the finished report** — `python3 ".opencode/skills/qa/scripts/check_session.py" --no-structure 99-report.md` —
it verifies that every row carries the same number of `|` as the separator row, that no cell exceeds the limit and that no secret value
slipped in. All three were eyeball checks until the script existed, and all three went out wrong at least once. Why a cell that feels short
enough is not, and what a stray `|` does to the row, are in `references/report.md`. Cut, first of all, the
enumeration of every measurement point, the verbatim quotes of requirements and the caveats about observation counts — those live in the
result file:
1. the first sentence **bold, in business language** — what is broken from the user's point of view, with no endpoint or field names (the
   test: is it clear to someone who has never opened the code);
2. the evidence with numbers — what the spec requires versus what came out;
3. the risk in user terms, not «the data does not match»;
4. needs an analyst's decision — say it explicitly, in bold;
5. the technical root cause as the last line, in italics: `*Tech.: …*`. The full workings (response codes, bodies, chronology, every
   measurement point) live in `result-*.md` — the report links to them rather than repeating them.

**6.5. Deliver the results to the user BEFORE the retro.** The report is written to a file, which the user does not see; the retro that
follows is a long series of edits across the engine, the profile and the knowledge base, and until it finishes the user is left watching
housekeeping with no idea how the round ended. So the moment `99-report.md` is finished, put its substance in the chat — the verdict per
task, the findings with their priorities, the answer to the question the session was brought with, what stayed uncovered and why, and the
ready-made tracker comment. Then do the retro. **The finale at step 8 repeats this whole delivery** and adds where the retro's lessons went;
that repetition is deliberate and this delivery is not made redundant by it — the user gets the result while it is still actionable, and can
correct the verdict before the lessons built on it are written into files.

**Open that delivery with the round's status list — one line per requirement, and in the chat only.** The manual tester's four verdicts
render as 🟢 pass · 🟡 partial · 🔴 fail · ⚪ not covered (its reason in the same line, ≤1 line total). Greens are listed one by one up to
five; past that they collapse into a single line («🟢 12 requirements confirmed») and only the rest is spelled out — a screen of green
buries the two rows that needed reading. **Icons never enter a file**: `99-report.md` is copied into the tracker whole, where an emoji
fares exactly as the HTML in a cell does (`references/report.md`), and a line must read correctly without its icon — a terminal may not
render it and a reader may not separate red from green. In round 2+ a changed verdict carries its transition: «🟢 FR-5 — was 🔴, fixed».

Precedent: the user asked for exactly this ordering after a session announced «the report is written,
now updating the knowledge base and the retro» and went quiet for several minutes of edits.

**7. The retro — a mandatory step, not an «if I feel like it».** The inputs are the **«Executor retro»** sections in `*manual-result*.md`
and `*automator-result*.md` (the executors are obliged to write them), **the analyst's retro from its final summary** (it has no file —
carry it into `7-retro.md` from your own context; the analyst most often complains about the plan and the profile rather than the
environment) plus your own view: where you got bogged down, what you violated, what information was missing, what the manager planned badly.
The output is `7-retro.md` in the format of a table «observation → rule → landed in», and **the fixes are made immediately, in the same
pass**. There are four addresses for fixes:
- **the engine** (the process: roles, acceptance, formats, degradations, this SKILL.md, the lesson catalogues in `references/`, the agent
  instructions, the templates) — **but first check that `engine-clone` is a clone at all**: the directory exists, it holds a `.git`, and its
  path is not inside `.opencode/`. Any of the three fails (and a missing key always fails) → the address is an *installation*, not a
  clone, and the lesson takes the route below instead. The project copy carries no `.git` and is a flat copy that the next
  engine update writes past, so an edit at either address disappears without an error — while the version bump is reported as if the lesson
  had landed. **With a valid clone** edit the files directly, with no git operations — the user is the one who pushes to git — and then
  **update the installed skill set**, because `/qa-setup` copies the files into the project and without this the edits will not apply: bump the
  patch version in `<engine-clone>/engine.json`, then pull the clone and have the user re-run `/qa-setup` (the engine's update step). The
  changes take effect from the next launch of opencode (the current session finishes on the old copy — that is fine, the
  retro is the finale anyway). **Without a clone the lesson is re-addressed, not dropped** — the degradation row at the end of this file says
  where it goes, and `<sessions>/engine-feedback.md` catches the universal remainder;
- **anything that goes into the engine is anonymised — no identifiers from the project.** The engine is a portable package that gets
  published outside the project it was written in, so its files must never carry a task id from your tracker (`ABC-123`, `service#456`), an
  environment hostname, a service, a company or an account name. Write the precedent by its mechanics — «precedent: a retest where the
  defect's symptom went stale together with the build» — and drop the address: the value of a lesson is in the mechanics, while the number
  is the client's data and nobody agreed to publish it. Session files, the project profile and the project's knowledge base are the
  exception — they live inside the project and may name anything. This is enforced, not trusted: `.github/scripts/validate-engine.py` in the
  engine's repository fails on a task-shaped identifier in the engine's files, so an edit that smuggles one in stops at CI;
- **the contract version — a mandatory question at every engine edit**: does the edit require anything of a project profile (a new header
  key, a new mandatory question in a section, a rename, a new expectation of the subfiles)? **Yes** → bump the «Current version» in
  `PROFILE-CONTRACT.md`, add a row to the version-history table (what changed and which sections are affected) and update `contract-version`
  in the current project's profile in the same pass. **No** → only the engine's patch version, the profiles are left alone. A skipped
  version bump is the retro's most expensive mistake: the engine has several consumers, and their profiles drift apart silently, without a
  single warning from `/qa`. The converse matters too: **an edit that does not affect the profile does not bump the contract version** —
  otherwise every project gets a false «your profile is behind» alarm and a needless `/qa-setup` run;
- **the project's profile and local skills** — tooling pitfalls, access, code maps: if an executor tripped over a project skill, the pitfall
  gets written into it;
- **the project's knowledge base** (the path comes from the profile) — what was learned about the **product**: API contracts, feature
  behavior, limits, «why it is this way». This is exactly what the manager reads at step 1, and that is how sessions feed the sessions that
  follow. Fixes about the **working process** go into the engine or the profile, not into the knowledge. When moving a finding over,
  distinguish a contract from an observation: a regularity drawn from N runs without support from the spec is recorded with the note
  «observation», not as an assertion. Precedent: «the cascade picks X first», from three lucky runs, went into the KB as a fact and was
  refuted by the fourth;
- in doubt whether it is the engine or the profile: the rule would work in any project → the engine; it mentions a specific
  tool/environment/class → the profile.

**Inside the engine, a lesson has two addresses and they are not interchangeable.** A rule keyed to a situation — this shape of scenario,
this state of the environment, this kind of executor failure — goes into the matching `references/` catalogue as one more entry
(`planning.md` for the shape of a scenario, `manual-brief.md` for briefing and for the run, `report.md` for the shape of a finding and
its wording). SKILL.md holds only the procedure: what the
step produces, which subagent it launches, what acceptance requires. Writing a situational lesson into SKILL.md is what made the step-3 and
step-4 sections grow to half the file, and the manager then paid for all of them in every session, including the ones where not one applied.
If a new entry has no obvious catalogue, that is a signal the procedure changed — and then it does belong in SKILL.md.

**Inside a catalogue the address is finer still: a new entry either stands alone or joins a FAMILY.** The catalogues carry families —
a head entry stating one mechanism, with its shapes under it (`### The order of the server-side checks`, `### The observation channel`,
`### Before a requirement is planned as «not covered»`). Before adding an entry, ask which mechanism it is a shape of: where a family
already states it, the entry goes inside as one more shape and says only what is particular to it, because the family's head has already
paid for the «why». A new entry that repeats a family's reasoning from scratch is how the catalogue doubled in size once — the same thought
met three times per session under three wordings, each read in full.

A lesson without an address is not a lesson. A hygiene rule: if a patch to an instruction repeats for the third time, fold it into the main
text instead of adding yet another phrasing — and if a third entry in one catalogue turns out to share a mechanism, that is a family, not
three entries.

**8. The finale.** Update `0-session.md` (the status, a row in the round log) and **the session registry `<sessions>/README.md`** — one
line: the task, the date of the last round, the verdict in one phrase, what was left on the environment, the folder (no such file — create
it: it is the entry point for the question «what has already been tested» and the source of the sanity check before the next run). **Do not
keep a run log in the project's AGENTS.md** — that file is loaded into every session: it holds only the project map and pointers to the
registries, facts about the product go into the knowledge base, and techniques into the profile's subfiles. A run log that has grown there
is a reason to unload it in that same retro. Precedent: 79% of the file was a log of 18 runs. To the user — the step-6.5 delivery repeated
in full (the paragraph below) and **the tracker comment**: check the write permission in the profile —
writing is not allowed → hand over ready-made text for the user to paste themselves. **Keep the comment short — 3–5 lines:** the verdict in
one phrase, how many findings there are and where they live, what is not covered, a link to the report. There is no need to retell the
findings in it — the findings table from the report is what goes to the tracker. **Never omit the autotest line**: no test was written —
write exactly that («autotest: none», with a reason if you like), otherwise the task's reader cannot tell «we didn't write one» from «we
forgot to mention it». For a bundle of tasks there is one comment covering all of them. Deliver it in the chat and leave it in
`99-report.md` (the section is rewritten for the current round's verdict).

**The finale's chat output opens with a «Test results» heading (in the session's language) and repeats the step-6.5 delivery whole — not a
digest of it.** The order of the finale is fixed and it is this one: **Test results** — the status list (one line per requirement, 🟢 pass ·
🟡 partial · 🔴 fail · ⚪ not covered, greens collapsed by the same rule), the verdict per task, the findings with their priorities, the
answer to the question the session was brought with, what stayed uncovered and why, the tracker comment — plus the two things step 6.5 could
not yet say: what was automated and the path to the session folder. Then the retro edits, then the action block. **Repeat the text, do not
compress it**: a digest sends the reader back up the scroll for the line it dropped, which is the whole problem this solves. The repetition
is deliberate, because between the delivery at 6.5 and here lies the whole retro — minutes of edits across the engine, the profile and the
knowledge base — and whoever steps away while the session works comes back to a screen of housekeeping. The last screen is the one that gets
read, and what the session was brought for is the result, not the bookkeeping of its own lessons. The detail stays in `99-report.md`, which
the repeat does not replace: it is the delivery again, not a second report. **Icons here too are chat-only** — the rule from 6.5 holds
unchanged, nothing with an emoji enters a file. Precedent: the user pointed out that whoever comes back after the session has finished sees
only the retro's outcome and has to scroll for the test results.

**As the last block in the chat — a summary of the retro's edits: one line per address, saying what exactly changed.** The addresses are the
same four: **the knowledge base**, **the engine** (mandatorily with the engine's version jump, `0.6.1 → 0.6.2`), **the profile** (which
subfile), **a skill** (which one exactly). The line format is `**<address>** — <what changed, one phrase>`; an address with no edits is
simply not mentioned, and «no edits» is a valid one-line answer too. From this summary the user sees where the session's lessons went
without opening `7-retro.md`. Example:

```
Retro edits:
- knowledge base — a new domain 12-auth-service.md (challenges, TTL, sessions)
- engine — 0.6.1 → 0.6.2: the findings rules into step 6, the priority scale into qa-manual
- profile — reporting.md: the project specifics stayed; auth-and-api.md: the rate limit and the 307/401 oracle
- skill temporal-qa — three new workflow prefixes
``` Commit only if asked.

**The last thing the session prints is the action block: `⚠️` for «I cannot close this without you», `💡` for «worth doing, safe to
ignore».** Every line states **an action, not a problem** — «Paste the comment into <task>: the profile's tracker token is read-only», never
«no write permission in the tracker». **`⚠️` is rare by rule — zero or one line is a normal round, two is already many** — and it is allowed
for three things only: a deliverable only the user can land (the tracker comment where writing is not permitted), a verdict blocked on
somebody else's decision (an analyst's call where the spec is silent), and access that must be fixed before the round can be closed.
Everything else is `💡`: the engine being behind upstream, a profile behind the contract, environment leftovers, a case candidate for the
next round, a fixture worth creating on the environment. If everything is urgent then nothing is, and a `⚠️` that turns out to have been
optional costs the reader's trust in every red line after it. The block appears **here and nowhere else** — with one exception that is the
same statement: a message where the session stops and cannot continue at all (no profile, the environment is unreachable, the mode cannot be
determined). It goes into no file; the report's «Open questions» is its file-side twin and the two must not contradict each other.

**In the same block — one line about the engine's own version, and only when it is behind.** Compare the installed `version`
(`../../engine.json`, the engine root above this skill) against one read of
`https://raw.githubusercontent.com/roystanalva/QA-Manager/main/engine.json`. Behind → «qa-manager is ahead upstream: yours 0.11.11,
upstream 0.12.0 — `/qa-setup` will update it, entirely optional». Otherwise, and **on any failure of the check — no network, a 404, a slow
answer — say nothing at all**: the line is a convenience, not a result, and an unrelated fetch may not add noise to a session's finale.
Nothing updates an engine on its own, so this line is the only place the user learns the engine has moved. The rest of the engine's
housekeeping — fetching the update, reconciling `engine-feedback.md`, offering it upstream — is `/qa-setup`'s and never a session's.

**9. After delivery the session is still open.** Almost anything the user says once the report has been delivered is either an uncaught
defect in your work or a gap in the rules, and each is handled **one at a time, immediately** — what is saved up for «the next retro» gets
lost along with the context. Two branches, and they are not interchangeable: **a question** is answered on the merits (a rule may be
*proposed* in one phrase, never written into the files unasked), while **an objection about a fact is re-checked by your own direct
observation first** — not by re-reading your own report — and only then are the facts fixed, the rules after them. **Read
`references/after-delivery.md` the moment it happens**: what a confirmed objection obliges you to edit and in which order, what a withdrawn
finding does to its ID, where the mini-retro goes, and what to do when the objection does not hold up — all of it is decided in the first
two moves and cannot be repaired afterwards.

## Side findings

`<sessions>/side-findings.md` — a shared file of remarks and bugs **outside the scope of a particular task**: sessions' side findings and
anything the user asks to «put/move into side findings». The format is a table (date, finding, where from, severity, status) — described in
the file's header. Do not confuse the addresses: knowledge about the product goes into the knowledge base, the course of the checks into the
session folder, and orphan bugs plus «somebody should look into this» come here. When a finding is closed, update the status; rows are never
deleted.

## Engine feedback

`<sessions>/engine-feedback.md` — where a retro's **engine** lessons go when there is no clone to apply them to (step 7). It is the user's
own log: a session sends nothing from it and asks nothing of them. The columns are the retro's plus the version the row was written under —
«observation · rule · address in the engine · engine version» — and the file's header says so, so it reads cold. Rows are never deleted: a
lesson that has since arrived in the engine moves to a «Closed» block at the bottom with the version it arrived in — the only place the user
sees their observation land. Reconciling the file, and offering the remainder upstream, is `/qa-setup`'s work.

## Capability degradations

| Capability = none | What changes |
|---|---|
| tracker | the input is only a free-form description from the user; ask them for the session's mode too (full cycle by default); the report's «tracker comment» is dropped |
| tms | cases are md files in `docs/test-cases/` (the default; the profile may override the path) (structure: preconditions, steps, expected result — as in a TMS); «mark automation» = a line in the case file |
| test-cases | `upfront` — step 3.5 runs, the analyst writes the cases, the manual tester does not create them; `inline` (and **a missing key**) — today's behavior: the manual tester creates the case after the run; `none` — cases are not maintained at all: `qa-analyst` is not launched, the manual tester creates no case, and the automator links the test to the task rather than to a case. With `tms: none` + `upfront` the cases are written as files in `docs/test-cases/` (or at the path from the profile) |
| environments | the check runs against a local launch per the profile's Environments section; the preflight check reduces to «the local environment is up» |
| logs | diagnostics only from response bodies; blockers are recorded without deep trace-id diagnostics — that is not the executor's fault |
| autotests | step 5 is skipped entirely; the report records «autotests are not maintained in this project»; qa-automator is not launched |
| browser | do not include UI scenarios in the plan; if the task is purely frontend, the session is blocked with an explicit message to the user |
| secrets | the sessions need no secrets; a scenario requiring credentials came up — the executor records a blocker in the result (credentials are neither requested nor invented) and the manager raises it with the user |
| knowledge | the step «read the product knowledge» is skipped; product findings from the retro are placed in `<sessions>/../knowledge/` (create it at the first finding) |
| engine-clone (also: no `.git` there, or the path sits inside `.opencode/`) | the retro does not edit the engine — the normal state for an engine installed into the project. The lesson is re-addressed: whatever is phrasable through this project goes into the profile or a project skill, the universal remainder into `<sessions>/engine-feedback.md`. No version bump — the engine arrives from upstream via `/qa-setup` |

## Boundaries

- **Browser work belongs to `qa-manual`, not to a role of its own.** A UI check is run through the real interface while watching the network
  (the rule and the techniques are in the agent's instruction and the profile's Browser section), and the manager's preflight at step 4
  verifies the access before the executor is launched. There is no separate web-tester and none is planned: a UI scenario and an API scenario
  belong to the same round, and splitting them would cost a hand-off in the middle of it.
- The manual tester and the automator work **sequentially** (the manual tester's result is the automator's input). Do not introduce parallel
  executors or a discoveries.md: the file scheme, the numbering and acceptance all assume one executor at a time, and a parallel round has
  never been the thing a session was short of.
- Secret values go nowhere: not into the session files (the folders may be backed up off-site), not into TMS cases, not into the report or
  the tracker comment. In request evidence the values are masked (`Authorization: <TOKEN>`). All the roles take credentials from the
  profile's `secrets` source — and reference it, not the values.
